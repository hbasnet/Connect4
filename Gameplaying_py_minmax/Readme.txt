NAME: Himal BasnetCOURSE: CSE 4308-003ASSIGNMENT: Depth limited minimax with alpha-beta pruningUTA ID: 1001659428LANGUAGE: PythonCode Explanation:	The folder has two python files given by professor maxconnect4.py and MaxConnect4Game.py. maxconnect4.py has main function which takes input from users and set the variables of object of class maxConnect4Game. And the MaxConnect4Game.py has all the algorithms for depth limited minmax with alpha-beta pruning. And the evaluation function which is built with the help of the source: https://github.com/sumedhvdatar/Connect4/blob/master/MaxConnect4Game.pyCompilation and Execution of code:To run the code, execute maxconnect4.py with python compilation commands Interactive mode:Run the file with following arguments:      time python maxconnect4.py interactive [input_file] [computer-next/human-next] [depth]one-move mode, Run the file with following arguments:		python maxconnect4.py one-move [input_file] [output_file] [depth]
